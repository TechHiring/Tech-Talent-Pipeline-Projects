<!-- Create an HTML page with a form. The form should include inputs for a username, email, and password as well as a submit button.
In a Javascript file, write code that does the following things:
-checks that the password is 12345678
-checks that the username contains at least one number
-if anything is wrong, send an alert message saying "incorrect"
Your page should also include an H1 tag. If the information in the form is correct, have Javascript change the text in the H1. -->
